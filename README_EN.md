# Preamble

*testaPP* provides a method for managing open and distributed storage locations of books worldwide. Open and distributed book storage locations (book caches) have no distinction between librarian (admin) and user. Every user participates as a librarian in the management of the library. This leads to confusion and inaccuracies. With *testaPP*, every user can organize access to tangled inventories and unclear knowledge of their current holdings. This concept is called *fuzzy accessibility*.

*testaPP* offers a solution to the problem that arises when a someone wishes to engage with open book cages, out of fascination with books and literature. The reason for the popularity of these lies in the fact of the inflationary abundance of books.

This abundance represents a social problem that cannot be solved by trying to reduce it. Rather, it is a matter of liquidating the surplus to access usability. In the context of *fuzzy accessibility*, societal surplus is not a problem, but a solution â€” one for which suitable know-how does not yet exist.

*testaPP* is conceived as a special case of geocaching. It is special because of the fact that only books are the objects of search and discovery.

With *testaPP*, an *open source software* is made available, which can be supplemented by additional components.
