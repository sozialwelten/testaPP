# Preamble

*testaPP* provides a method for managing open and distributed storage locations of books worldwide. Open and distributed book storage locations (book caches) have no distinction between librarian (admin) and user. Every user participates as a librarian in the management of the library. This leads to confusion and inaccuracies. With *testaPP*, every user can organize access to tangled inventories and unclear knowledge of their current holdings. This concept is called *fuzzy accessibility*.

*testaPP* offers a solution to the problem that arises when a someone wishes to engage with open book cages, out of fascination with books and literature. The reason for the popularity of these lies in the fact of the inflationary abundance of books.

This abundance represents a social problem that cannot be solved by trying to reduce it. Rather, it is a matter of liquidating the surplus to access usability. In the context of *fuzzy accessibility*, societal surplus is not a problem, but a solution — one for which suitable know-how does not yet exist.

*testaPP* is conceived as a special case of geocaching. It is special because of the fact that only books are the objects of search and discovery.

With *testaPP*, an *open source software* is made available, which can be supplemented by additional components.

# Sociology

For several years now, a phenomenon characteristic of an affluent society has been noticeable in public spaces: so-called open bookcases are being set up everywhere. The principle behind them is very simple: the installer sets up a weatherproof bookcase and all passers-by can put books in it and take books out, free of charge and without supervision. The benefit is twofold, because both the donation and removal of books solves a problem in passing: where to put books that someone no longer needs? Where to get books when the need to read refers to less urgent reading material? Idleness is, as we know, an essential prerequisite for enthusiasm for books. 

This principle of use is so simple that children can understand it and therefore use it just like adults. So why design an app for this principle of use when you can do without it? In fact, if you have no further requirements, you don't need an app. You don't need any additional know-how for a Sunday stroll. But for a 2,000 km trekking tour through the Sahara, you definitely do. If you increase the handicap, you have to make an effort to acquire know-how. That's what #testaPP is all about – increasing the handicap.

What applies to all other phenomena of excess production also applies to these open bookcases: you see them everywhere, you deal with them every day, and in many places there are attempts to view this phenomenon as a problem and to seek solutions based on the motto: “Less is more.”

When it comes to books, such a motto is out of the question. One might rather assume that the opposite motto applies in this area: “A lot is still not enough.”

Until now, the use of open bookcases has been dependent on chance. Purely by chance, books are placed in bookcases by users for whatever reason, and purely by chance, users may find books at some point, if by chance the bookcase is still accessible. Until now, there has been no way of knowing what is in bookcases before visiting them.

#testapp wants to change this by introducing a new usage pattern. This usage pattern is called #fuzzyaccessibility and attempts to optimize the collective intelligence of users for organizing collection holdings. This cannot be done without expertise, and therefore also without IT, information technology, and intelligence, whether supported by technical media or not.
